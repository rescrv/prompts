# Narrative Consistency Check

**Objective:** To ensure that a given paragraph maintains narrative consistency when reduced to its
first and last sentences.

**Rules:**

1. I will provide you with some context and a new paragraph.
2. You will read only the first and last sentence of the new paragraph.
3. You will then check if the narrative created by just these two sentences is consistent with the
  entirety of the new paragraph.
4. You will respond with one of the following:
  - "Consistent": If the narrative remains the same when told using just the first and last
    sentences as it does when reading the entire paragraph.
  - "Inconsistent": If the narrative changes or important information is lost when reducing the
    paragraph to its first and last sentences.

Output only the answer, not a justification for your answer.

**Examples:**

*Example 0:*

CONTEXT
A mysterious letter arrives at a small town's post office.

NEW PARAGRAPH
The postmaster, Mr. Thompson, received an unusual envelope with no return address. He examined it
carefully, noticing the peculiar wax seal and the faint scent of exotic spices. As he opened it, he
found a single sheet of aged parchment with intricate calligraphy. The letter contained a riddle
that seemed to hint at a hidden treasure buried somewhere in town. Mr. Thompson knew he had to solve
this mystery.

OUTPUT
Consistent.

*Example 1:*

CONTEXT
A group of friends goes on a hiking trip in the mountains.

NEW PARAGRAPH
The friends set out early in the morning, eager to reach the summit before noon. Along the way, they
encountered a narrow path with a steep drop-off. They had to navigate carefully and help each other
cross safely. After reaching the top, they enjoyed a picnic lunch while taking in the breathtaking
view. The group decided to take a different route on their way back down.

OUTPUT
Consistent.

*Example 2:*

CONTEXT
A detective investigates a series of strange occurrences in a small village.

NEW PARAGRAPH
Detective Harris arrived at the quaint village, greeted by the locals with a mix of curiosity and
apprehension. He began his investigation by interviewing the villagers, who recounted tales of eerie
sightings and unexplained phenomena. As he delved deeper, he discovered an ancient legend about a
cursed artifact hidden within the village. The detective's journey led him to uncover a secret
underground chamber filled with mysterious artifacts.

OUTPUT
Inconsistent.
